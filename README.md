## qb-kleding
- For BestPixel we have created an easy script that allows us to display clothing as an item and make it usable. We are currently still working on the script, so we advise NOT DOWNLOAD it until the final version is completed. In addition, everything is linked to the clothing as we have set it up and can therefore differ for everyone. To get more information on how to customize it, check out Credits/Links.

###### Releases ######
Check out the releases here or go to https://github.com/meistroburger/qb-kleding/releases

###### WORK IN PROGRESS ######
- The script is not complete yet, so we don't recommend using it if you don't know what you want to do with it. You can always make improvements, but then we would like to see this reflected. If you want to use this script yourself for something else, a mention of credits would be nice. Do you have any improvements, comments and/or problems? Please report this so that we can improve the script together.
###### Images ######
- Images must be placed in qb-inventory

###### Shared.lua ######
